# Torch to the Metal

Welcome to **Torch to the Metal** - a comprehensive guide to Deep Neural Networks using PyTorch.

## About This Project

This project combines theoretical foundations with practical implementations to help you understand and build deep learning models from the ground up.

### What You'll Learn

- **Fundamentals**: Start with perceptrons and basic neural network concepts
- **Recurrent Networks**: Explore RNN cells, LSTM, and GRU implementations
- **Practical Skills**: Learn through working PyTorch code examples
- **Best Practices**: Understand training, optimization, and model deployment

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Explore the code examples in the `code/` directory
4. Read the book chapters in the `book/` directory
